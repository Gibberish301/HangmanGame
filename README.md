Hello there!

Whether you are a friend or a stranger, I really appreciate it a lot that you are checking this out!
I've worked really hard on this for the past couple of months and I'm proud of what it is now.
Don't get me wrong, this thing is probably spaghetti code, unorganized (and undocumented, sorry).
But I worked hard and thats what matters right? Oh, and also it works too.

Game description:
A blank word is shown to you, and you have to input one letter at a time.
If the letter is in the word, all the times that letter shows up it will replace one of the blanks.
If you fill out the word completely, you win!

Once you win one game, you can access the word pool, or all the words the computer chooses from.
Here, you can add or delete words from it.
You can add just about anything, just not a number, something less than 2 characters, or a word
already in the word pool.

Thats just about it!
The project is really small, but I am really excited of what I'm gonna do next!
Actually... I still don't know what I'm gonna do next.
